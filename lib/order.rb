#bit of a problem in that I can only get the sequence below to work if
#the methods are on the same line (otherwise rspec just calls the last one)
#and as a result I can't give the check_order_prompt, show the selection, show the total
#and then prompt the user to confirm checkout... I could of course just
#tell them to run the method to complete checkout but I assume we're not assuming
#a user is using ruby to place their order... though I guess we weren't assuming
#a user was using ruby to literally land a plane, so...
